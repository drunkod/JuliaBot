```
chmod +x libs/libntgcalls.so

go build -ldflags="$GO_LDFLAGS"

```

I see that we're still facing issues with finding `libntgcalls.so`. Let's try a few more steps to resolve this:

1. First, let's make sure `libntgcalls.so` has the correct permissions:

   ```
   chmod +x libs/libntgcalls.so
   ```

2. Now, let's modify the `shell.nix` file to include the `libs` directory in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

   ```nix
   shellHook = ''
     export CGO_CFLAGS="-I${pkgs.xorg.libX11.dev}/include"
     export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L${pkgs.xorg.libX11}/lib -lX11 -L${builtins.toString ./libs} -lntgcalls"
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${pkgs.xorg.libX11}/lib:${pkgs.gcc.cc.lib}/lib:${builtins.toString ./libs}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
     export LIBRARY_PATH="${pkgs.xorg.libX11}/lib:${pkgs.gcc.cc.lib}/lib:${builtins.toString ./libs}:$LIBRARY_PATH"
     
     # Set the rpath for the Go binary
     export GO_LDFLAGS="-r ${pkgs.xorg.libX11}/lib -r ${pkgs.gcc.cc.lib}/lib -r ${builtins.toString ./libs}"
   '';
   ```

3. Exit the current Nix shell and enter it again:

   ```
   exit
   nix develop
   ```

4. Now, let's try to build and run the program:

   ```
   go build -ldflags="$GO_LDFLAGS"
   ./main
   ```

If you're still encountering issues, let's try to diagnose further:

1. Check if `libntgcalls.so` is actually in the `libs` directory:

   ```
   ls -l libs/libntgcalls.so
   ```

2. Try to run the executable with `LD_DEBUG` to see detailed information about library loading:

   ```
   LD_DEBUG=libs ./main
   ```

3. Check if there are any version mismatches between the libraries. Run:

   ```
   readelf -d libs/libntgcalls.so | grep NEEDED
   ```

   This will show you which libraries `libntgcalls.so` depends on.

4. Make sure your Go code is correctly loading the library. In your Go code, you should have something like:

   ```go
   // #cgo LDFLAGS: -L${SRCDIR}/libs -lntgcalls
   // #include <ntgcalls.h>
   import "C"
   ```

   Ensure that the path to the library is correct.

5. If you're using any build constraints in your Go files (like `// +build cgo`), make sure they're correctly set.

6. Check your `go.mod` file to ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and versioned.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide:

1. The output of `go version`
2. The content of your `go.mod` file
3. The relevant part of your Go code where you're importing and using the C library
4. The output of `readelf -d libs/libntgcalls.so | grep NEEDED`

This additional information will help in further diagnosing the problem.
